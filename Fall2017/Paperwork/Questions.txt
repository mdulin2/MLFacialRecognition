Questions to ask:

1.  Would the project have to do real-time detection to be actually beneficial?2.  Will cloud computing be necessary to handle the computing load of neural networks?3.  Is a product where the tint of the screen changes color based on what emotions are detected a viable project?4.  What kind of product would you like to see in this field?5.  How are we going to find a sponsor?6.  Is there anything specific you would like to see done on this project?7.  What do you think of our idea to test multiple approaches, and write up our results from each method?8. What resources would be available to us for this project?9. What share of time do you think we would need to split between research and development?10. Would you have us prioritize improving current approaches or trying to develop our own approach?11. Would it be better for each of us to tackle specific areas of the problem or have each of us do a little bit of everything?12. Are there any machine learning experts get us in touch with?13. How much theory would present upon or is implementation more of the focus?14. Would you rather have us make our own training sets or use existing ones?15. Are there any local businesses that we could contact to test out our product at?16. If we do create our own dataset, what will be the best way to get people to contribute to our project?17. Have there been any previous projects that have done machine learning tasks?18. Are we free to use any of the computer labs extensively?19. Are there any business professionals that could help us make our product marketable?20. Should we assume the reader knows anything about the theory of machine learning in our write-up?
