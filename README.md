# Facial Recognition Log In and Sign Up API  
This software is an API for web developers to implement facial recognition  
sign up and log in into their websites.  
It uses Docker to allow our software to work with most backends, and while  
we provide sample camera front end components, as long as the right data is  
being sent to our backend, it should work!
